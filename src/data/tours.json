It’s the stage for a gripping, life-and-death scene where the wildebeests must survive the danger of the water’s currents, the stampede of its own herd, and the jaws of the Nile crocodiles that lie in wait.",

Wherever you go in the vast Masai Mara, you will see an abundance of wildlife such as Masai giraffe, baboons, warthogs, bat eared foxes, grey jackals, spotted hyena, topis, impala, hartebeests, and wildebeest. Elephants, buffaloes, zebras, and hippos are also found in great numbers. It is also common to see lions either basking after a heavy meal or surveying the plains for their next meal. Cheetahs and leopards are harder to spot but reasonably common.\nThe annual wildebeest exodus, great migration, in July and August when millions of grass eaters move north from the Serengeti in search of lusher grass before turning south again in October. Hot-air balloon trips are an entirely outstanding way of seeing the savannah plains teeming with wildlife can be arranged at extra cost."

The great migration which occurs every year from July to September is possibly Mara's most famous feature. More than 1.5 million wildebeest and zebras migrate from the Serengeti to the Mara. The Serengeti and Mara parks are interconnected wildlife havens and both are a photographer's paradise!\n\nAt noon, you'll arrive at your lodge for check-in and lunch, relax for a few hours before you embark on an afternoon game drive to discover Masai Mara National Reserve.

The trip is rounded off by a bubbly bush breakfast served on a view platform above the Masai Mara. There is an extra fee for the activity of $490 per person.\n\nEven if you choose to remain with two feet firmly on the ground this morning, you still have ample chance to spot animals on a dawn game drive before breakfast back at your accommodation. The rest of the day will be spent traversing this vast land, flat and grass covered, lunch is offered today as a picnic, relaxing by the Mara river and surrounded by the wildlife."

In a local town, you’ll stop for lunch and a chance to stretch your legs on the journey.\n\nEntering Amboseli, the most striking feature is undoubtedly Mount Kilimanjaro. The mountain stands steadfast; an eternal backdrop to all your photos of the park. As you head towards your accommodation, you will have a brief game drive. The lands here have more trees than the Masai Mara, yet the same brilliant range of wildlife is present, too.

Once the clouds start to build, it’s back to your camp or lodge for breakfast, before another full day out exploring the plains.\n\nHaving lived a nomadic life in these lands for thousands of years, the Masai people have a special connection with the savanna. Their culture has tales of lion-fighting warriors and they have a deep understanding of the lifecycles of Amboseli. One can will be shown around the village and presented with a chance to visit a house of one of the Maasai families. This mind-expanding visit is an optional extra, priced at $20 per person."

Along with a second chance to photograph Kilimanjaro without the daytime clouds, you get to appreciate the dawn chorus of the birds and mammals rising from their slumber and calling to their herds, prides, and flocks as the new day begins.\n\nOnce you’ve had your fill of nature, it’s time to fill up on food at your camp or lodge and take a long, slow, drive out of the park so you can fit in one last game drive. From the gates of Amboseli, it’s off westwards to return to Nairobi. This is your last chance to watch the world pass by and eat a delicious lunch at a local town.\n\nUpon arrival in Nairobi in the early afternoon, the next step is up to you.

Many of the cheetahs are so tame that they seek shelter from the hot sun under one's vehicle and several even climb onto the roof to get a better view of prospective prey. For the bird enthusiast, almost 500 species have been recorded: among these 16 species of eagle, plus many hawks and falcons, 6 species of vultures, 8 species of storks 4 of bustard (including the kori bustard, the world's heaviest flying bird), and 9 species of sunbirds.\n\nNote: Accommodation can be upgraded to higher-level options or downgraded to more economic ones (price reduction)."

It's a world of dense forests, beautiful waterfalls and unusual highland moors. Wildlife here includes elephants, waterbucks, bushbucks, buffaloes and hyenas, as well as very-hard-to-see black rhinos, black leopards and the much-prized bongo antelope.\n\nWe will pick you up at the airport or hotel and start an early morning drive to Aberdare. Keep an eye out for wildlife this morning as our transfer to the next part of your safari doubles as a game drive. The drive is scenic via the central Kenya highlands with 2 stops to view tea and coffee plantations. You will arrive on time for refreshments, dinner and overnight."

Samburu has also played host to over 390 different bird species, not to mention northern species such as reticulated giraffe, beisa oryx, gerenuk and Grevy's zebra. And the natural backdrop is one of the most spectacular in Kenya.\n\nYou're in for a treat when you stay at Ashnil Samburu Camp. It's surrounded by doum palms alongside the Ewaso Nyiro River, inside Buffalo Springs Game Reserve but well located for Samburu National Reserve just across the river. Wildlife is everywhere, and the stunning tents are large, have wood floors, and most have stirring views.

Rich birdlife, pretty acacia forests, and a towering escarpment overlooking the lake all add to the natural drama.\n\nYou'll stay in a corner of Lake Nakuru National Park which Lake Nakuru Sopa Lodge has all to itself. The views from just about anywhere in the lodge are the best in the park, and the rooms are large, lovely and filled with light.

For the bird enthusiast, almost 500 species have been recorded: among these 16 species of eagle, plus many hawks and falcons, 6 species of vultures, 8 species of storks 4 of bustard (including the Kori bustard, the world's heaviest flying bird), and 9 species of sunbirds.

Despite its changing habitat, Amboseli National Park is possibly the best wildlife area in the whole of Africa to experience elephants at close range.

Kingfishers use the papyrus as a perch, herons hide in it while searching for food.\n\nLake Naivasha is yet another area popular for bird watching (over 400 species have been recorded). It is also a favourite weekend retreat for Nairobi residents, who come here to sail, water ski and fish. There are no crocodiles in the lake as the water is too cold for them, due to altitude but there are a number of hippos. Along the lakeshore, vineyards produce grapes for the country's fledgeling wine industry."

For the bird enthusiast, almost 500 species have been recorded: among these 16 species of eagle, plus many hawks and falcons, 6 species of vultures, 8 species of storks 4 of bustard (including the kori bustard, the world's heaviest flying bird), and 9 species of sunbirds."

There may be almost two million flamingos in residence at any given time, forming a stunningly beautiful deep pink band around the edge of the lakeshore. You will arrive in time for lunch and an afternoon game drive. Dinner and your overnight stay will be at a campsite or lodge.\n\nNote: Accommodations can be upgraded to higher level options or downgraded to more budget friendly options (price reduction)."

Many of the cheetahs are so tame they seek shelter from the hot sun under vehicles. Several even climb onto the roof to get a better view of prospective prey!\n\nFor the bird enthusiasts - almost 500 species have been recorded here. Among these include 16 species of eagle, many hawks and falcons, six species of vultures, eight species of storks, four species of bustard (including the Kori bustard, the world's heaviest flying bird), and nine species of sunbirds.\n\nNote: Accommodations can be upgraded to higher level options or downgraded to more economic ones (price reduction)."

Also, you'll have a fantastic sunrise in front of you. The sunrise in the African Savannah is one of the most beautiful experiences one can have. After the game drive, return to the camp for brunch. In the afternoon, transfer to Ngorongoro, the 8th Natural Wonder of the World. With walls, 2,000 ft high and a crater floor that spreads for 102 sq miles, the crater is a virtual Noah's Ark, inhabited by almost every species of wildlife indigenous to East Africa including the rare black rhino.\nThe large bull elephants that reside here have extremely large tusks, due to the rich mineral content of the volcanic soil and its grasses. They are the most incredible elephants you'll ever see in your life."
